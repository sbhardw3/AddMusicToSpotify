This program takes your access and authorization from the Youtube API. For spotify API it somewhat requires the same thing as YouTube API you need authorize your project then, 
it will provide you with your CLIENT IDs. I am not providing my client IDs because that is confidential! but i have a program getToken() here which takes your CLient IDS from 
spotify and gives you a token so there is an access to your spotify account. You also need to authorize with spotify so that program is able to use user-modify-library function
